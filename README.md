Audio Utility is a music management tool, which includes 
- Loudness Meter Checker is a loudness measurement tool suitable for mastering, which I am currently using FFmpeg to process the volume 
- Symlink helps to do it. Shortcut Folders connect from other drives to drive C, which is another way to save a lot of space 
- Restart Audio service provides an added level of help to restart the sound driver or restart an audio engine for every driver when there is a problem 
- Fixing VstPath helps manage files and folders plug-ins in multiple addresses. Not all of them are called. This is managed by creating a folder and moving the files into one place, and the Registry will finish resetting default VSTPlugins to one place. Rescan) //ref.Problems with Ableton and many other programs 
- Spectrum Analyzer is an audio graphing assistant that processes graphs as image files (processed by FFMpeg) 
- install plugins (.dll), plug-in wizards loaded into compressed files or plug-ins that are ready to use instantly 
- Audio Converter, an assistant for converting audio files in an emergency, or converting data files
